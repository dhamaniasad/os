I am attempting to develop an OS, based on Ubuntu, that, using a speech synthesis engine, talks to the owner. I'll be adding a list of my goals below : 

#### Goals
1. Finalize speech synthesis engine to be used
2. Finalize speech recognition engine to be used
3. Make it say good morning to the user; somewhat like this : 
    
`Good Morning Sir. The weather forecast for today is : 
Minimum 30 degree celsius
Maximum 45 degree celsius
Clear skies with chances of thunderstorms in the afternoon.
How are you doing today, Sir? 
Owner replies I am fine, whatever, how are you doing today PC? 
CPU load average 5.89; 27% memory free. CPU running at 50 degree celsius, all systems are functional. `

Well, yeah, something like that. Its a very rough idea rigth now, and I'll be working on implementing it when I get the chance.
